# Shape-Finding
Implemented a Shape Finding program that finds various listed shapes of adjacent subsequent same numbers(from 1 to 5) in a large two dimensional matrix.
The shape and the number both are chosen by the user through console input, the iterative algorithms in C are run for different shapes and the output is displayed in a new file.
